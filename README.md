# sequential-choice
A small JS library for creating sequential-choice quiz or poll questions, compatible with React. Sequential choice is similar to multiple-choice but you must select all of the choices in a specific order of priority. This is mobile friendly and interactive with yes, no, and back buttons options for each question.
